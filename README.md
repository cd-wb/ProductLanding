## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Continued development

I want to focus on the flexbox and grid in future projects because they help me to simplify my website and also to create responsive layouts. One of the great things about Flexbox is the way it handles the distribution of space within a container.
